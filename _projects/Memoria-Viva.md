The Living Memory Project began back in 2009 on the 70th anniversary of the end of the Spanish Civil War with the recording of the event, organized in Paris to the Spanish Exiles and the victims of the Nazi extermination camp of Mauthausen. Our goal thereafter focused on collecting the greatest possible number of testimonies related to the history of Spanish anarcho-syndicalism. As part of the celebrations of 100 years of CNT we set up the project, the union decided to fund it and we set off . We travelled 12,000 km visiting three countries relying on the logistical support of CNT and selfless work of their members as well as partners Malicious Films GuerrillART. This is the result: -80 hours worth of records -300 hours worth of testimony in timing and transcription meant for reference purposes at the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation -0 actors
The Movie will be presented in spanish with english or german subtitles depending on demand.
